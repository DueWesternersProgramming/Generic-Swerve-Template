This repo is created by the software subteam of FRC team 8575 to use in the future if we chose to use a swerve drive train again, and is also avalible to other teams to use as a template to copy and use as well.

Info:
-We have tried and tested this code on a robot running regular Neos and Spark Maxes with SDS MK4i Swerve Modules.

Getting started and other setup details:

-Most of what you need to change to get up and running is located in Constants.java including controller axis, (Configured for a Logitech F310 Gamepad), and change CAN IDs to match your configuration.
-You also will want to pay attention to the swerve drive gearing, (Also defined in Constants.java), we used L2 gearing and will need changing for other gear ratios.
